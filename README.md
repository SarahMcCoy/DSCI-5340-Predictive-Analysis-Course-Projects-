# DSCI-5340-Predictive-Analysis-Course-Projects-

"Welcome to our GitHub repository showcasing a semesters worth of collaborative projects from DSCI 5340 Predictive Analysis. Throughout this course, we delved into advanced statistical forecasting and predictive modeling to tackle real-world scenarios. 

Each project explores a new topic or concept, providing hands-on experience in applying machine learning techniques such as feature extraction, feature engineering, and performance evaluation. We've also ventured into analyzing non-traditional data using specialized analytical techniques like support vector machines, text analytics, and neural networks.

The repository serves as a testament to my mastery of advanced analytics tools in R and our ability to solve complex data-driven business problems. Join me on this journey of discovery and innovation as we showcase our collective expertise in predictive analysis."
